To enable real-time updates (edit JSON → see changes without restart), you need to rewrite the loading code to:

Fetch JSON dynamically at runtime (via fetch or import()).
Add polling (re-fetch every X seconds) or file watchers (dev-only, auto-reload on save).
Store the data in mutable state (e.g., Zustand/Redux/Context) that updates components live.

This turns your JSON into a "hot-swappable" data source — no rebuild needed during dev.
Rewritten Code: Dynamic JSON Loading with Real-Time Updates
Assume your JSON is in a data/ folder (e.g., data/player.json, data/characters.json). We'll use fetch for runtime loading + a simple polling interval (checks for changes every 5s in dev). For production, remove polling or use WebSockets.


Proposed File Structure Organization
Based on your description, we're evolving from the original nested array structures (like in Game.js) to a more modular, dynamic system:

JSONs as DB-like data models: Static blueprints (rooms, characters, events, dialogs) loaded at runtime.
Dynamic fetching/updating: Use fetch/polling (as in previous code) for real-time dev changes without restart.
React for rendering: Components pull from state (Zustand/Redux), update on data changes.
Event distinction: Use a dedicated event handler model (from our discussions: triggers like onEnter/onExit/onSelect/onTalk, with conditions/commands).
Story flow: Texts/dialogs/scenes in separate JSONs — not baked into code. Load dynamically based on events/threads.
Modular separation: Universal components in one folder (reusable UI like cards/menus). Scenario-specific in branches (e.g., per quest/room). Storytelling in dedicated folder with texts/dialogs as JSON (by thread/event for dynamism).

This keeps everything separate and reusable:

Universal: Shared components (e.g., EntityCard, ActionMenu) for standardized look.
Dynamic: Events/threads as JSON objects (not hardcode) — load per room/character/scenario.
By Scenario/Branches: Group by story arcs (e.g., church quest folder with its JSONs/components).
Storytelling Folder: All texts/dialogs/scenes as JSONs (thread-based structure for branches).

No invented rules — this is standard for React games (e.g., data-driven like in Unity ECS or Godot scenes, but JS/JSON focused).
