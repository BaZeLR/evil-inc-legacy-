<God, I wish my boyfriend wasn't overseas right now. I've been so horny lately. Especially at work...I wonder what this little nerd has under his coat.>
<That fucking janitor was staring at me again! I told daddy but he hasn't done anything about it yet. I should just fuck him then say he raped me. HA! That would get rid of him for good! I wouldn't mind a fuck anyway  and the creepy old janitor would be so wrong and kinky....><Why are you staring at me fag boy?>

Katie,
<God why did I do it? Shit I cant go back I just cant go back. Not while [b]HE's[/b] there.......>,
<God please don't let that freak from the gym see me here again! I know he's the one that broke into my locker and stole all of my stuff including my mothers locket. I would do anything to get it back....>,
<My life is so fucking ruined! What am I going to do. I cant just sit in here all day. God please don't make me turn to that strip club downtown. I here those girls are all fucked up on stims. Then the owner rents you out. No that wont be me!!!>,
<Fucking Justice Force....>

Holly,
<Wow that was the largest STD I have ever seen!>
<Dr. Hart asked me out today, but I turned him down again. One of the nurses said he spends a lot of time down at the Uranus Lounge. I would never be with someone like that.>
<Is it just me or are all the nurses around here super hot or is it just me?>
<I've seen more and more victims of super attacks lately. There has to be something I can do! >

<I still cant believe I got an interview with the Justice Force! Oh my god oh my god oh my god! Finally I'm going to have a chance to make a difference. It's what Andre would have wanted....>
<This class has gone to shit since Katie left. I wonder what happened to her I hope the girls alright. I know she was living downtown near the strip club. I hope the owner didn't convince her to start "dancing"...>
<The professor sure has been moody lately>
<Ugk who's that pale wimp in the lab coat. God  I should tell him to put a sun lamp in his moms basement or something...>


Melody,

Fuck I'm going to let daddy down....He was right I am worthless.>
<I Just need to bide my time. I'll take over his company in no time.....>
<I need to remember to check out the school gym , I heard there were a group of supers that like to hang out in there. They would make great test subjects. A few wouldn't be to bad to fuck either.>
<Velma, you little fucking snoop! I saw you following me out last night. Little bitch wants some blackmail on me she's going to need to try harder than that!>

Hmmm, maybe I should play with Xander a bit before I take him in! Its great that he's more scared that I'll reveal that he's gay than actually getting caught! HA! Men and their fucking pride! Oh well I'm gonna make sure he the bell of the ball!>
<I will be taken seriously as a police officer! Duty and family above all else!>
<Dad's been so busy with the "super" problem lately he rarely has time to see me any more. I've been so lonely lately. That's it tonight I'm going out and getting fucked!>

<I'm worried about Duggie, since Valorie died he's really changed. This whole Doctor Evil persona is completely ridiculous. My sister really brought out the best in him. After the accident it all changed.>,
<Steven....God, I hope you know what your getting yourself into. Dr. E and me chose this path a long time ago. I'd hate to see Steve get hurt in their war.>,
<The Justice Force...fucking pathetic...If only the people knew they were three root cause of most of the problems in the city. Their the real criminals. I know for a fact the leader isn't The Goddess like everyone thinks she is!>


Cid,
<So this is the guy Tom was telling me about? Hmmm, not what I was thinking he would look like.>,<Holy Three forgive me! This is all my fault! Why didn't I stop that group from entering?!

Diabolic Priest,
<I miss my home...The city stinks of piss and fear. If it wasn't for the resurrection I would never come here and hide in the darkness! My town needs me. >,
<It's ridiculous that they continue to test us to pay tribute to Minos! How many years have I been apart of this group! I remember a time when we were all just farmers and traders meeting in the back of bars!>,<Shh...pigs...stay quiet! pigs ..or else...Quod me nutrit, me destruit....>,
<I noticed a locked door up stairs....Seems like it was unlocked yesterday....I wonder what's inside?>

Strange Occult Member,<I barely heard your message old friend but I think I caught the jist. >,
<My orb should keep most of these freaks away from me for the most part. I tell them how the light burns and the pain gives me powers. Idiots...>,

<That strange man in white has been inside the guarded room since before I got here. What could the goddess want with him?>,
<Watching the souls swirl around the artifact is kind of soothing. >

Mysterious Occult Member,
<Those fucking cunts are locked up real tight. Ain't nobody going to touch before the goddess. If this doesn't sway her favor I don't know what else will.>,
<Shit where did I put that fucking key?>,<Old Crow freaks me the fuck out!>,<That artifact giving off light is totally going to fuck with my complexion.>



Occult Guard,
<None of the other member take this serious enough!>,<I will not allow any past me with passing my test first!>,<Some of the older member know the answers to my test. They better keep quiet about it.>,
<No Face thinks he has the best tribute but he doesn't know of the one already inside. Without that man none of this would have been possible. I cant wait to see the look on his face when she chooses another over himself.>

Shadow Cat,
<I am never teaming up with this fucking freak show again! I going straight to Starry Night!>,
<Mmmmm my last encounter with Odin went SOOO well...I could see his hammer rising  the whole time I spoke.>,

<Stuck in a cell with Ole Puss in boots...Yeah the time of my life...>,<Sometimes I think I should just say fuck it and star playing on the evil side. It look so much more fun!>,
<All of these other prisoners keep moaning out and it's got me soooo wet. I wonder if kitty is good at licking pussy?>,<What I wouldn't do for a shot of whiskey right now...>

Parker Tower Security,
<Fuck I hate my job...Cant wait until my shift is over and I can get a drink down at the Devil Pit in Deacon.>,<I wonder what that artifact was that they brought in last week?>,<Why do they even need security here if there are freaking Super's living upstairs?!>,
<I cant believe Arachnid is upstairs! I'm such a fan boy! Todd was telling me he tried to say hello and the guy bit his head off. I'll just keep to myself.>


Peter,
<One day we'll be together again, my love.>,<The meteorite fragment may just be the piece we need to unlock it's potential.>,
<James is getting lazy again. I'll have to speak to him about his performance.>,
<Jenny I've got your number, I need to make you mine, Jenny don't change your number.....I got it (I got it) I got it, I got your number on the wall, I got it (I got it) I got it, For a good time, for a good time call...>


Penthouse Butler,
<No one lies to Mr. Parker. That is if they want to live. >,
<Master Peter and Mistress Melody are nightmares. A nest of vipers they are! Oh and it's only going to get worse when his wife comes back from Europe.>,
<It's a good thing they don't know about the cameras in Melody's Room. If they ever fire me I'll black mail the fuck out of them.>,
<I found a crumpled up piece of paper while I was cleaning the their day. What's ocelot69 suppose to mean?>

Penthouse Maid,
<Miss Melody is such a tease...>,<The poor butler deserves better than this place>,
<I swear somehow Mr Parker always knows what's about to happen! Sometimes it's lie he knows the future...It's uncanny!>,
<Mister Parker is so strict now. He wasn't always this bad. He changed around the time his wife started traveling without him years ago...>



Parker Technology's Scientist Bob,
<I think that invisible ink got on Carol's shirt. Gal's got a nice rack.>,
<One day I'll crack the formula for artificial powers and I'll finally have the X-Ray Vision I always wanted!>,<Jane seems too young to work here. Is she related to the Parker's?>,
<It's not easy being the smartest guy in the room....>

Parker Technology's Scientist Adam,
<If the formula is correct then the tangent of the cosine equal the.....>,
<I love me some red heads. I wonder what Carol's up to today?>,
<Firestorm lives in the building. What did Chad say she lives in Apartment 53? That fier crotch always struck me as kind of a prude....>,
<Chad said the Knight Wing kid is a fucking drunk. He and Lisa were doing some updates. In the kids bedroom were a dozen empty pints scattered across the floor.>

Parker Technology's Scientist Carol,
<I swear if I find out which guy is pranking me I'll so get him fired. This is the third time my project was rigged to leak all over...>,
<Security is getting too relaxed around here for my taste.>,
<Mr. Parker said if my performance doesn't improve I'm fired. What will I do then?>,<Knight Wing is pretty cute but I cant tell if he's straight. >


Parker Technology's Scientist Jane,
<Fucking hate Carol. Stupid Whore!>,
<It's me that fucking with you! Dumb cunt....>,
<I'd do anything to move up in this place. If Carol wasn't talking shit, I'd probably already be her boss.>,
<Just the sound of her voice makes me......Errrr.....>


Parker Technology's Maintenance Worker Chad,
<Too bad all the Super Babes are off on some training retreat. I love it when the ladies are around. I used to think Knight Wing was lucky but he must be gay if he hasn't made a move on any of them.>,
<I love watching the hidden cameras in the super's apartments. Boss said they supposedly know about the cameras but by the footage we got I'd say it was well hidden in the fine print.>,
<I wish I had access to the 4th floor server room. Place is a gold mine of information of the justice force!>,
<We're not aloud anywhere above floor 3. Guess the Parkers like their privacy...>

Parker Technology's Maintenance Worker Lisa,
<I can't believe everyone here is treating me like some dumb tramp. I have a degree in electrical engineering...!>,
<I saw that Butler from the penthouse down in the basement the other day. He was acting very strange. I didn't know he ever left the 5th floor. I wonder what he was doing? >,<That safe Mr. Parker ordered was he real deal. A 7 digit numeric code? Yeah try breaking into that.>,
<That scientist Jane has some crazy fucking eyes...>

Parker Technology's Janitor Al,
<All these white women are constantly giving me the elevator eyes...>,<One day I'm going to own this place.>,<The women's restroom sure does have a ton of graffiti in it. Someone really hates Carol...>,
<What's that glowing rock down in the basement? Was I exposed to it?>

Parker Technology's Janitor Ed,
<I should just bring a bomb in here and kill everybody. Motherfuckers....Don't even appreciate the work I do to scrub their shit...>,
<Their so fake. No one even knows my name...>,
<Those supers disgust me. They oughta drown' em at birth. Hmph!>,
<Is it break time yet?>

Parker Technology's Lawyer Shannon,<The clerks are totally my bitch.>,
<The number of patents this place files is outstanding. Soon they'll rival AEON.>,
<Should I call Al to come clean something up for me? Mmmmm....>,
<and there....done. Whenever The Sentry actually gets signed by the justice force the papers will be ready.
They really make the Junior members jump through hoops to become a full member.>



Parker Technology's Office Clerk Drew,<John always making us look so bad...>,
<I've never seen Moon Shadow in the building. I know she lives somewhere on floor 2.>,<This place is taking a toll on me...>,<Wish I had powers....>



Parker Technology's Office Clerk John,
<Drew's a fucking idiot.>,
<Xxceptional is SOOO strong! She's so much like Extraordinary. Are they related...?>,
<Ed told me he saw Shulk coming out of apartment 53 late last night. What's the green giant doing here slumming it with the rookies? >,
<I cant wait for dance class later tonight!>


Hungry Tony's Cashier,
<You'll never guess how many times I spit in your food! Faggot!>,
<Go ahead fat ass order a diet coke that will help!>,
<I hate my job! At least I can get stoned in the parking lot during my breaks. The manager usually rolls a blunt.>,
<Uck, I don't know what's worst smelling like fried food all the time or getting use to it and not smelling it any more.>
