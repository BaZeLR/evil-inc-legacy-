"The JF have recently released a study on the mutation rate in humans. It stated there's a slight increase in the percentage of infants born with the meta gene. In the past the percent of infants born was stated at .00001%. However the most recent analyst is stating the new percentage at .00002%. This could mean trouble in our future."
"That's barley any different Les..." Ron says causing Leslie to cringe and bite her tongue.
"Ron the rate is double what they thought. That's a big difference. Imagine twice as many of these Super's running around."

Rosa blows a kiss to the audience at home. The yellow dress she wear clings to her curvy frame and shows quite a bit of cleavage and leg.

"The Channel 4 News is brought to you by the Justice Force." Leslie says in her french accent.

"Hell yeah!" Rosa yells from off screen and Leslie just shoots her a look of disgust. One might read it as silently asking why are you doing that?

"Breaking News we have footage of Blue Bolt laying siege to the Business District. Police and Justice Force have shut down the area until the meta has been dealt with."
continue pressed
"Blue Bolts sudden appearance was met with several dead and many more hospitalized in critical condition.

Mayor Krump has made a statement that he will not tolerate this kind of civil disobedience and has authorized the use of lethal force. Krump is up for re election at the end of this year and stands upon a platform to register all Meta and refusing any more residency inside the city." Ron says.

"Well talk about an idiot eh Leslie? I mean how hard is it to write something like that down? Am I right folks?" Ron gestures to the camera.
