I\"VE HAD ENOUGH!!!!\" Shouting at the fat blue ape writing on the floor. You feel energy building up inside your head like before but this time different.....\n\nWith that. A powerful mental blast detonates from with in you. Sending everything not nailed down flying through the air! When It hits Herbert, his eyes begin to glow a odd color. \"What the hell was that? I've never done that before....Your eyes.... What the hell is the matter with you Herb?\"\n\n\"Nothing......master.....\" The big man moaned out in a low voice.\n\n&lt;Huh? Did he just call me master?&gt;\n\n&lt;In extreme circumstances... You will be able to surpass your limitations to control ones mind. In these cases you crush their will, turning them into mindless slaves, now bound to you. You now know Domination it is located under abilities. Using this ability renders the target into a mindless state. They keep all their memory's but the person they were ceases to exist. However they will follow your orders and are 100% devoted to you.&gt;\n\nYou dominate the poor fools mind....\n\n&lt;Herbert from now one you are 100 % devoted to my interests. You will do everything I say without question and be completely honest with me. You wont remember me until you hear my voice but will still follow my commands even though you wont know why. After I question you. I want you to go back to your normal routine and act normal, but from now on you'll be my eyes and ears around campus. Got it?&gt;\n\n\"Yes master...\" He mumbles.\n\n\"Good now I have some questions to ask.\"",
